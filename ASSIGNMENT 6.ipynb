    "Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real life entities. Class. A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.\n",
    "An object's state is defined by the attributes of the object and by the values these have. In your case, name, age, gender. The term \"behavior\" refers to how objects interact with each other , and it is defined by the operations an object can perform.\n",
    "Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance. We define class attributes outside of all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header."
